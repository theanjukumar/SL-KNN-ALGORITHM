# SL-KNN-ALGORITHM
KNN is a lazy learning, non-parametric algorithm. It uses data with several classes to predict the classification of the new sample point. KNN is non-parametric since it doesn't make any assumptions on the data being studied, i.e., the model is distributed from the data.
# STEPS TO WRITE THE ALGORITHM OF "KNN"
1.Host the data

2.Loading the data with sklearn

3.Split the data train_test_client

4.Apply classfier

5.Predict the model

6.Check your accuracy

#If value of "k=2" .It means clustering called as by linear clustering #
# PROJECT TITLE

Make the prediction for "iris.csv" using KNN algorithm of MAchine learning
# CONCLUSION

It "k=3" successfully implemented
